Statement of Purpose

The laws of nature, including the mathematical structure described in
this work, are universal and belong to humanity. The purpose of this
document is to make available to the public, irrevocably and
unconditionally, all rights in the Work, so that the public can freely
use, modify, and build upon it.

1. Copyright and Related Rights. The Work may be protected by copyright
and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and Related Rights").
Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited to, the
following:

  i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,
     communicate, and translate a Work;
 ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or
     likeness depicted in a Work;
 iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work;
  v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data
     in a Work;
 vi. database rights;
vii. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data
     in a Work.

2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention
of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently,
irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of
Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes
of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as
future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories
worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or
treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future
medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever,
including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional
purposes (the "Waiver").

3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason
be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the
Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted. In addition,
to the extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each
affected person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non
exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's
Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories
worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or
treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future
medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever,
including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional
purposes (the "License"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the
date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the
License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under
applicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not
invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer
hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her
remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any
associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work, in
either case contrary to Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.
